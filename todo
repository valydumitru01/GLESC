TODO: Change order of access modifiers in documentation, the standard is public, protected, private
TODO: Change exceptions in initializations like SDL or OpenGL to ASSERTS, because they are not recoverable and
      they are not expected to happen. If they happen, it's a bug. It also makes the code more performant because
      asserts are not compiled in release mode.
